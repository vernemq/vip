# VerneMQ Improvement Proposals (VIP)

This is the repository to add elaborated VerneMQ Improvement proposals and feature requests.

We don't have to be as formal and organised as the Erlang Enhancement Process: https://github.com/erlang/eep.

The VIP repository is not for quick feature requests, as sometimes proposed under the VerneMQ main repo issue tracker. Please only add proposals that you have elaborated a little further than just the bare minimum. If you don't have a technical proposition, maybe you still have an elaborated use case (that's welcome!).

Please make sure that your proposal does not imply breaking the MQTT specification(s), as found on the OASIS site:
-  https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html
-  https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html

Feel free to discuss your proposals on Slack and Googlegroup before or after you've added them here. You can add your proposal as a single Markdown file to the VIP directory in this repo, or you can open a Github Issue containing the proposal.
